# C# Project Euler

## What is this?

Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net) presents a set of Computer Science problems for anyone to solve.

Almost any language can be used, and many of the challenges require carefully considered solutions to meet the pass criteria (eg: no problem should take longer than a minute for your solution to solve on an 'average' PC).

## Why am I doing this?

Practice makes perfect!  Solving problems in a new programming language can both reveal their limitations _and_ justify their features.
